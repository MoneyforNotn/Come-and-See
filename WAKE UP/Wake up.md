### Perception and Mind

Your perception of yourself can impact how others percieve you and vice versa. If you hold yourself to a high regard, you will carry yourself more and confidently. Opposite is true, if the environment around you treats you favourably or it promotes a sense of confidence in yourself which you embody. But not only can changing your perspective change how others regard you, your perception of yourself can ultimately change you from the inside so that, over time, you actually become the version of who you seek to be.
