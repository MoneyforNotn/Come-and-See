## Mozambique's ISM

Insurgency Northern Mozambique is facing a nightmare that almost nobody is talking about. More than 107,000 people have been forced to run for their lives in just the last two weeks (Dec 26) and since this conflict began in 2017, over 1.3 million people have been uprooted, with their villages being attacked and burned to the ground. The violence is driven by a group known as ISM, or Islamic State Mozambique. In the northern province of Cabo Delgado, a little-known Islamist group started attacking police stations and villages, feeding off years of anger about poverty, corruption, and the fact that local people were not seeing any benefit from the huge gas and ruby projects on their own land. Young men with no jobs and no hope were easy to recruit, and the violence slowly turned into a full-blown insurgency. Over time, the fighters pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and became known as ISM, while the government and foreign troops tried and failed to fully stop them, sometimes committing abuses themselves. 

In the past, ISM fighters would attack a village and leave quickly, but nowadays they are staying for weeks at a time, turning safe areas into zones of permanent fear. They have spread from the far north down into new regions like the province of Nampula, where fighters dressed in military uniforms are moving from village to village, killing civilians. The situation is so desperate that people are not even waiting for the attacks to start. Pregnant women, children, and the elderly are walking for days just to get away because they know what is coming. The humanitarian situation for these families is catastrophic, as the United Nations says that in this latest wave of people fleeing, only about 40% have received any food at all, and even those lucky few only got enough supplies to last for two weeks. Aid agencies simply do not have the money to help, because the international response plan is only 14% funded. This lack of support is forcing people to make a deadly choice, because they are starving in the displacement camps. Some families are attempting to go back to their war-torn villages just to find something to eat even though they know they might be killed.
