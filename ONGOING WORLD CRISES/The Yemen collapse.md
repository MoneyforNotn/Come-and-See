## The Yemen collapse

Yemen is facing one of the world's worst crises, and it's barely being covered. The country is basically collapsing, as more than 17 million people, who make up almost half the country, are facing crisis levels of food insecurity. This number is thought to be increasing instead of decreasing, and by next year, it is expected to rise to over 18 million. In some districts, more than 40,000 people are facing catastrophic starvation. This began with a war that exploded in 2014, when Houthi rebels from the north took over the capital and pushed out the government. 

A few months later, in 2015, a Saudi-led coalition launched airstrikes and a blockade to try to restore that government, shattering the economy, destroying hospitals and infrastructure, and cutting off salaries for millions of people. Over time, the country split into rival zones of control. The Houthis in the north, the Saudi-backed government in parts of the center, and southern separatists known as Southern Transitional Council, or STC, backed by the United Arab Emirates. Recently, the STC launched a massive military attack. And in just a few days, they captured key cities, military bases, and the region's oil fields. This is a huge turning point because these separatists now control the entire southern coast and the oil, and they want to split Yemen into two separate countries again. 

Today, the economy is broken, aid is being cut, and massive flash floods are washing away the few farms that are left. On top of all of that, Yemen is fighting the worst cholera outbreak in the world. In 2024 alone, it reported nearly 250,000 suspected cases, which is about 35% of all cholera cases on the entire planet. There is a funding gap of $20 million, and life-saving treatment centers are being forced to close their doors. If no money comes in, sick people will simply have nowhere to go. Delicate situations like these are difficult to come by, and even if you see them, it's hard to get an objective view on them, as different sources report stuff through different lenses.
