## Haditha massacre

On the morning of November 19, 2005, in the Iraqi town of Haditha, a roadside bomb tore through a U.S. Marine convoy. The explosion killed a Marine instantly and left two other Marines badly wounded. Within hours, that turned into one of the darkest chapters of the Iraq War. The Marines shot five unarmed men who had been ordered out of their taxi, killing them on the spot. Then, they entered nearby houses. Inside were families with grandparents, parents, and children as young as one year old. Nonetheless, 19 civilians were killed in their homes, most shot at close range in the chest or head. By the end of the day, 25 unarmed civilians were dead, with the youngest victim being just three years old. The Marine Corps' first official story was false. 

They claimed that 15 civilians had been killed by the roadside bomb and that eight insurgents died in a firefight afterward. However, an Iraqi human rights worker filmed the aftermath. Bullet holes in walls, bloodstains on floors, and bodies of women and children with gunshot wounds. A Time magazine reporter then began investigating and found that doctors at the local hospital confirmed that none of the bodies showed bomb injuries but close-range gunshot wounds. A nine-year-old girl who survived said she saw her grandfather shot first in the chest and then in the head. followed by her grandmother. Investigations stretched on for years, and at first, eight Marines were charged, but case after case collapsed. Some Marines received immunity in exchange for testimony, while others had their charges dropped. By 2008, nearly all charges were gone, and the only Marine punished was Frank Wuterich. He admitted to negligent dereliction of duty, lost rank and pay, but avoided jail. For many Iraqis, this outcome was unbearable, as families who had lost multiple relatives in one morning saw six years of U.S. military prosecution end without a single Marine imprisoned. 

Survivors called it an assault on humanity. Lawyers for the victims urged international courts to take up the case. Meanwhile, the U.S. military paid $38,000 in compensation to some families.
