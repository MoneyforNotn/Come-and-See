## Ethiopia situation

Ethiopia is being torn apart by brutal fighting, mostly in the Amhara region. The National Army is at war with a local armed group known as the Fano Militia, but innocent families are also paying the price. Both sides are committing terrible crimes, including killing people without a trial and using heavy weapons and drones to bomb neighborhoods where civilians live. This comes from the war that started from 2020 until 2022, when Ethiopia was in a conflict in the Tigray region. The Ethiopian government was against the Tigray People's Liberation Front, and the Fano militia was actually fighting alongside the Ethiopian government, helping them. When a peace deal was signed in late 2022, though, many Amhara felt betrayed and shut out, especially over disputed land they believed should remain under their control. In 2023, the government announced that it would dissolve regional special forces and fold them into the federal army. And in Amhara, this plan sparked protests and then open fighting as parts of the security forces joined Fano instead. 

The government responded with a state of emergency, mass arrests, and heavy drone strikes, and the Fano militia, once siding with the Ethiopian government, became their enemy. A full-scale insurgency started in the region, and the scale of the tragedy is massive, as between early 2023 and the start of 2025, at least 7,700 people died, and thousands of them were civilians. The military has even attacked hospitals, beaten doctors and patients, and blocked life-saving medicine from getting through. Because of this, more than 40% of all health facilities in the conflict zones have been looted or destroyed. Also, the future of an entire generation is basically being erased, as over 4,100 schools have shut down, leaving a staggering 4.1 million children with absolutely no education. On top of the war, the government has used the chaos as an excuse to crush freedom. It used special emergency rules to arrest thousands of people without warrants simply because of their ethnic background or political views. Journalists and human rights workers are being harassed and thrown in jail. Meanwhile, ordinary people are facing high food prices and a terrifying wave of kidnappings in which gangs are snatching university students and demanding ransom.
