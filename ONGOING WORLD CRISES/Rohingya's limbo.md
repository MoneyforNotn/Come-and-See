## Rohingya's Limbo

Right now, more than a million people are trapped in a place that was never meant to hold them, with no clear way out and less help coming in every day. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority from Myanmar who have been denied citizenship for decades and treated as if they do not belong in the country. Long before they arrived in Bangladesh, they faced harsh laws, hate campaigns, and repeated waves of military violence that forced many to flee. 

In 2017, this exploded into a brutal crackdown in Rakhine State, where soldiers burned villages, killed civilians, and drove more than 700,000 people over the border in just a few months. Today, they are in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, where over a million Rohingya refugees are living packed together in the largest refugee settlement on Earth. They fled extreme violence in neighboring Myanmar eight years ago, but instead of the crisis ending, it is actually getting bigger. Because of new fighting in Myanmar, roughly 130,000 more refugees arrived in 2025 alone, and the reality on the ground is bad. A recent survey found that the vast majority of refugees are terrified to go back, but they also have no future where they are, as life inside the camps has become a desperate struggle for survival. About 35% of families do not have enough safe food to eat, and the same number have absolutely no income. Because global funding is drying up, there are fewer chances to work for aid groups, leaving families with nothing. On top of the hunger, the camps are dangerous. Gangs are kidnapping people for ransom, recruiting young boys, and trafficking women. The shelters are overcrowded, and when the monsoon rains come, disease spreads quickly. 

This misery is also creating tension with the local Bangladeshi people living nearby. When the refugees first arrived, the locals were generous, but now they are struggling too. They have seen their forests cut down to build the camps, their water sources dry up, and their wages drop because desperate refugees will work for almost nothing. The situation is about to face a critical point because the money is running out. The official aid plan for 2026 has been slashed by more than $250 million compared to the year before. Aid agencies are forcing different departments to merge just to save cash. For example, they are cutting back on food rations so that only the very hungriest families get full support, while others get less. They are also closing some service points for protecting women and children to save on costs. Meanwhile, the political solution is stuck. 

Bangladesh recently announced that Myanmar had agreed to verify 180,000 refugees for potential return. But for the people in the camps, this feels like a lie. One refugee called it nothing more than an eyewash, pointing out that unless they are granted citizenship and safety, a list of names means nothing.
