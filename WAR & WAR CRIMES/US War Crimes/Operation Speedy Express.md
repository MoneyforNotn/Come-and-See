## Operation Speedy Express 

This was one of the most brutal and controversial US campaigns of the Vietnam War. You can get an idea of what really happened when you hear that the army reported about 11,000 enemy killed but recovered only 750 weapons from the dead. 

Operation Speedy Express, carried out from December 1968 to May 1969, and run under Major General Julian Ewell, had the official goal of destroying Viet Cong bases, cutting supply lines, and re-establishing US control over a region considered a stronghold of the Viet Cong, the Mekong Delta. On paper, the operation looked like an overwhelming success, considering that just 242 American soldiers died, while the enemy lost 11,000. With a ratio of 45 to 1, it looked like a decisive victory, but the numbers hid something darker. The fact that only about 750 weapons were recovered means that thousands of those killed were probably unarmed civilians. The Army's own Inspector General later estimated that between 5,000 and 7,000 civilians were killed during the operation.

The campaign relied on overwhelming firepower, like helicopter gunships, artillery barrages, and fighter-bomber strikes, in a heavily crowded region with civilians. This basically turned entire areas into free-fire zones. David Hackworth, a highly decorated battalion commander, admitted openly, a lot of innocent Vietnamese civilians got slaughtered because of the Yule Hunt drive to have the highest body count in the land. Survivors and witnesses described whole villages wiped out with civilians getting shot from the air as they tried to run. A Viet Cong commander later explained, ‘Most of the people killed were civilians, because civilians would run. We soldiers held our positions.’ Reports of atrocities began to surface in 1969, but they were overshadowed by the My Lai Massacre, which we've just talked about. In 1972, Newsweek published an investigation by Kevin Buckley and Alexander Shimkin called Pacification's Deadly Price. They had interviewed villagers and studied hospital records. In one provincial hospital, they found that three-quarters of the civilian wounds treated came from U.S. firepower. Not Viet Cong attacks. Their conclusion was that thousands of civilians had been killed during Speedy Express.
