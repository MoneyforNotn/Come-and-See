## The Global Groundwater Emergency 

While many know about how bad the climate crisis is, they don't know specifically how bad it's getting recently. Nearly 6 billion people, which is about three-quarters of the entire human population, now live in areas where the freshwater supply is under threat. Satellite data shows that drying regions are expanding by an area twice the size of California every single year. The main problem isn't just that rivers are drying up. It is that we are basically mining the water underground. This groundwater is supposed to be our backup plan, for when the rain stops, we are pumping it out much faster than nature can put it back. In fact, 21 of the world's 37 largest underground water reserves are being emptied faster than they can refill. We are using this water mostly to grow food, as about 70% of all the groundwater we pump is used for agriculture. It is what allows farmers to grow crops in dry places like the Middle East, parts of the United States, and India. But the cost is huge. India now uses more groundwater than China and the United States combined. 

In the famous Ogallala Aquifer in the U.S., which helps grow a huge portion of the country's food, water levels have fallen so low that there is no real plan to save what is left. You must keep in mind that when we pump too much, the ground itself also starts to change. In coastal areas, taking fresh water out allows saltwater from the ocean to rush in, ruining the water supply and damaging people's kidneys if the water is consumed. Even worse, as the water is sucked out, the land above it begins to collapse. This is called land subsidence, and it is causing cities like Jakarta and Lagos to literally sink, cracking roads and breaking buildings. As the ground shifts, it can also release toxic metals like arsenic into the water, leading to higher cancer rates for the people drinking it. Scientists call this a risk tipping point; as once the water drops below the reach of our wells, the farms stop working, and there is no backup left for the next drought. We know how to fix this with better irrigation and stricter rules, but politicians often ignore it until it is too late. We are currently caught in a dangerous loop where climate change causes more droughts, so we pump more groundwater, which makes the land sink and the water toxic.
