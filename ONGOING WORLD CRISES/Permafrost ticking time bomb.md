## The Permafrost Ticking Time Bomb 

The Arctic is heating up four times faster than the rest of the planet, and one of the biggest stories you are not hearing about is the ground literally melting beneath people's feet. This is called permafrost. Permafrost. It is ground that has stayed completely frozen for years, and it covers a massive amount of land, about a quarter of the entire northern hemisphere. But now, that frozen ground is thawing. Imagine the earth under your house suddenly turning into mud. This is causing landslides and massive sinkholes that swallow up the land. It is washing away entire coastlines and destroying the food sources that local communities rely on, like fish and reindeer. 

Even scarier, this melting ground is releasing harmful materials that have been trapped in the ice for thousands of years, such as toxic mercury and ancient germs that could cause new diseases we have no immunity to. This is a disaster for the people who live there because their cities are built on that same ice that is turning into water. We know that at least 120,000 buildings and thousands of miles of roads and pipelines are sitting on top of this melting ground. Experts warn that by the middle of this century, nearly 70% of all essential infrastructure in the region could be at risk of collapse. A recent study looked at how much money is actually made on this frozen land and found that economic activity there is worth up to €189 billion in a single year. The vast majority of this wealth comes from just three regions in Russia, where massive oil, gas, and mining operations are built directly on top of the permafrost. Adapting to the thaw by fixing the roads, saving the hospitals, and moving the buildings before they fall could cost up to €82 billion in the Russian Arctic alone.
