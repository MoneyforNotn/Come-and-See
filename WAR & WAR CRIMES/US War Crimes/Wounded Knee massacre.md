## Wounded Knee massacre

Before sunrise at Wounded Knee Creek, Cavalry surrounded the Native American band of Lakota and began collecting their guns. Tension grew as soldiers searched the people, and a deaf Lakota man named Black Coyote held onto his rifle, and during a struggle, it went off. In that instant, soldiers opened fire on the entire camp, even though most Lakota men had already been disarmed. The army's Hotchkiss guns fired into the tents where women and children were hiding. In less than an hour, more than 250 Lakota were killed or fatally wounded. 25 U.S. soldiers were also killed. 

Survivors tried to flee, but they were chased and shot, and some soldiers finished off the wounded where they lay. A blizzard followed the massacre, and three days later, civilians gathered the frozen bodies and placed them in a mass grave. Four infants were found alive, still wrapped in their mother's shawls. The army removed Colonel Forsyth, who had led the operation, but later reinstated him. An inquiry criticized his tactics but did not blame him. Nineteen Medals of Honor were then awarded for wounded knee. Native leaders and many others have condemned those awards for decades, but most recently, in 2025, the Defense Secretary announced the medals would not be revoked.
