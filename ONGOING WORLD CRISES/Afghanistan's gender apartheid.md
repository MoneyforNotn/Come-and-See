## Afghanistan's gender apartheid 

In August 2021, after 20 years of war, the United States and its allies pulled out of Afghanistan under a deal struck with the Taliban, and the Afghan government and army, built and funded by the West for two decades, collapsed in 11 days. Four years after the Taliban swept back into power, Afghanistan's girls are in a bad situation. There's a slow and deliberate effort underway to make women and girls basically disappear from public life. This is happening right now to 21 million people, and it is not just about one or two new rules. It is a system designed to push women out of schools, out of jobs, and eventually to keep them entirely inside their homes. The most visible tragedy is in education. Girls are banned from school after the age of 13, and women are barred from universities. This means an entire generation is being cut off from learning, and the impact is already devastating, with nearly 80% of young women now sitting at home with no education, no job, and no training. 

Even for the younger children still in school, the system is collapsing. UNICEF and UNESCO warn that 90% of 10-year-olds cannot read a simple text, and thousands of schools have no clean water, heating, or even safe buildings. Experts warn that if this ban continues, nearly 4 million girls will be denied a secondary education by 2030, costing the country billions of dollars. However, the restrictions go far beyond that. In August 2024, the Taliban introduced a harsh new set of rules, formerly called the Law on the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. This law forbids women from traveling without a male guardian and even bans them from speaking or singing in public. More than 3,300 men have been assigned specifically to enforce these rules. Women are no longer allowed in parks, gyms, or beauty salons. If they break the dress codes, they face arrest and violence. This constant fear has created a mental health crisis. 

Experts also predict that these bans will cause child marriage to jump by 25% and maternal deaths to rise by 50%. This is happening while the health system is falling apart, since because women are banned from working, there are fewer female doctors and nurses, which means female patients often cannot get care at all. All of this is taking place inside a country that is starving. More than half the population needs urgent aid, yet international funding has dropped dangerously low. To make matters worse, millions of Afghan refugees are being forced back into the country from Pakistan and Iran. Meanwhile, resettlement programs in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada have been slow, leaving thousands stuck in limbo with no clear future. Even within the Taliban, there are cracks in the system. A senior minister named Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai publicly criticized the education ban at a graduation ceremony, saying there was no excuse for denying knowledge to the people. After his speech, reports say the Taliban's supreme leader ordered his arrest, forcing Stanekzai to flee to the United Arab Emirates. 

The International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Taliban leaders for crimes against humanity. Germany, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands have jointly brought a case to the International Court of Justice, arguing that the Taliban's treatment of women violates international treaties. Australia has even imposed direct sanctions on Taliban ministers.
