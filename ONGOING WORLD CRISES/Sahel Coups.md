## The Sahel Coups

Right now, in a long strip of land across Africa called the Sahel, more than half of all terrorism deaths in the world are happening, and most people outside the region have no idea this is going on. 

For decades, governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have neglected their remote regions, leaving people poor, unprotected, and angry at corrupt officials. After the fall of Gaddafi in 2011, heavily armed fighters and weapons flooded into the Sahel and helped launch a rebellion in northern Mali in 2012. Jihadist groups took advantage of the chaos and of local fights to spread across borders into Burkina Faso and Niger. And over time, many people lost faith in elected leaders and turned to military rulers instead. The numbers that result from all of this are terrifying. About 22.5 million people need urgent help just to eat and stay safe, with most of them being women and children. Violence has forced nearly 7 million people to run for their lives, leaving their homes behind. For example, armed groups are blockading villages to starve the people inside. They also plant roadside bombs, destroy water systems, and burn down schools. Furthermore, they are specifically targeting education, threatening and killing teachers, which has left over 1.7 million children with nowhere to learn. 

But it is not just terrorist groups committing these crimes, as national armies and government-backed militias are also accused of horrific abuses, including executing civilians, rape, and torture. In Mali, for example, the army has been working with Russian mercenaries, and together, they have been accused of massacres where hundreds of innocent people were killed. For years, Western countries like France and the United States had troops there to help, but the violence only spread, and recently, military leaders took over the governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. kicking out the Western troops and UN peacekeepers. Since 2019, deaths from terrorism have increased almost tenfold, and in 2024 alone, more than 25,000 people died in the conflict. On top of the war, the environment is collapsing. Temperatures in the Sahel are rising faster than almost anywhere else, causing water to dry up and forcing farmers and herders to fight over the little land that is left. Aid groups are trying to send food and medicine, but it is dangerous and difficult to reach the people who need it most.
