# Deep State

The deep state is a conspiracy theory; it's defined as the people within the U.S. government and military who are in secret control of government policy. Secret? Please, people. The deep state is those people within the U.S. government who are career employees that cannot be fired by the people we elect, by Congress or the President.

These include the FCC, the CIA, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the IRS. Are these people in control? Can they enact laws? Fuck yes. They're called regulations. For every law that Congress passes—and we elect Congress to pass our laws—there are 20 regulations enacted by federal agencies that have far more impact on our lives than anything Congress can possibly pass.

Is there a deep state? Yes. Can we fire these people? No. Can presidents fire them? No. It's designed that way so that political parties and political interests cannot affect the deep state. Do you understand the nightmare of our situation, people?

I'm sorry, it's not secret. It's as open as anything could be. In the past, since 1975, 200,000 regulations have been passed by our federal agencies, encompassing 800,000 pages of fine print. 

It is as open as it can be. The 'deep state' does control America

## All Politicians are "Transients"

Presidents have no power, and have had no power since 1960. Let me tell you, the CIA runs America.

Why? Well, first of all, they're all career patriots; they are, good God, people who truly love America. You know what they call presidents? Transients. "Got a new transient coming in." They control the transient. How? Because presidents and Congress are all transients; all politicians are transients. Presidents and Congress are there for four, or eight years — certainly presidents, eight years max.

Many of them are career politicians. How many of them speak Farsi or Saudi or Arabic? How many of them understand the nuances of political alliances, cultural histories, social and religious attitudes? No, they don't know jack shit.

Whereas in the CIA, which is a lifetime job—you never quit the CIA, you join at 22, you're there until you die. In the CIA, there are agents who speak 35 fucking languages fluently. Now, what do you think they think of it? They all understand everything, including the nuances of war. What attitude do you think they have towards a president? An idiot, an ignoramus—which they all are compared to the CIA—comes into the office and expects to run this country. They are not letting that happen, and they have not let that happen.

How do they control presidents? Let's take the glaring example that we all know: the Second Gulf War. The CIA wanted Saddam out of power. They tried to assassinate him, but it didn't work. So they said, "Okay, somebody tell the president to bomb him." Now, they didn't just say, "Go bomb him." No, you know what they said? "Mr. President, please have a seat. We have some terrible news. We have just discovered with absolute certainty that Iraq has nuclear weapons and they have ballistic missiles capable of reaching our closest ally, which is England. And Mr. President, we regret to tell you that we fear an attack is imminent on England. Now, Mr. President, we are not here to advise you. No, no, no, no, no, that's not our job. We're only here to inform you." No, they're here to fucking control you.

What options did the president have? None. We all knew, everybody knew, they had no nuclear weapons. Europe knew, certainly all of the Middle East knew. The only people who didn't know were the President and Congress, who were briefed by the CIA. Six hours later, the bombing started, and we bombed Iraq into the Stone Age. That's how the CIA operates: either through lies or selective truth.

Now, Dwight, let me finish this very quickly. Dwight Eisenhower, in 1960, when he left office—the last president with any power in America and also the last president with any goddamn common sense, except for JFK—warned us. He said, "If you do not do something, the CIA and the military-industrial complex will steal America and all of your freedoms." But we did nothing, and they did.

Now, the next president after Dwight Eisenhower, JFK, he was a smart motherfucker, and he goes, "Wait a minute, you motherfuckers are controlling me." So he announced, "I'm disbanding the CIA and I'm taking all of those departments. We're going to parcel them out with the other 14 covert agencies like the NSA, Secret Service, the military covert agencies, and so on." Unfortunately, two weeks later, he had an accident—got shot in the head, right?

Now, tell me that the CIA does not run America. You want to call that the deep state? I don't care what you call it. The Illuminati? They probably are very illuminated. They are the smartest people on this planet, I'll tell you that, because they are the best trained, the most educated, and the most involved in what they think is best for this country. The problem is, what they think is best for the country, according to the Constitution, shouldn't make a frat's ass of difference.
